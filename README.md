# Tic Tac Toe

This is one of my milestone projects that I've built after learning the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, & JavaScript.  It's nothing too fancy, it's just one of the typical Tic Tac Toe sites but with some extra configuration.

## Website

You can play the project I've built by visiting this link below!

## 1. Set player name for both players 

Luckily, this Tic Tac Toe website allows you to configure player usernames simply just by clicking on the edit button. It will not let you start the game if you don't set the players names first. After setting the player names, click Start New Game and it will beign the game!

## 2. How to play the game

I'm pretty sure you're old enough to know how to play the game but I'll just assume that you don't know. You can hover on the light purple boxes and when the box or square turns into dark purple, that means your cursor is inside the square. You can just click/tap on the box and then it will display your assigned symbol which can be either X or O. In order to win the game, your assigned symbol must at least but aligned with each other either horizontally or diagonally. If no one wins the game then it ends with a tie.
